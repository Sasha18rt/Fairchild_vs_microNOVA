\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this report is to compare two computer architectures, Fairchild 9440 and microNOVA MP/100, both of which were launched in the same technological era. This comparison will provide insights into their designe philosophies, capabilities, and use cases.

The Fairchild 9440 and microNOVA MP/100 were developed during a time when transistor-based computers were becoming more common, marking the transition from low-scale integration (LSI) to larger-scale integration in computing. By analyzing these architectures, we can understand the constraints and innovations of the time.

\section{Elementary Base of Architectures}

\subsection{Fairchild 9440}

\subsubsection{Elementary Base}
\begin{itemize}

    \item Packaged in a 40-pin DIP (Dual In-line Package).
    \item Operates with a 5V power supply and consumes approximately 1W of power.
    \item Supports compact, high-speed operations suitable for minicomputer-class systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{microNOVA MPT/100}

\subsubsection{Elementary Base}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hybrid system using multiple integrated circuits, such as mN602 and mN615 (proprietary Data General chips), along with additional chips like Intel 8048-based processors for peripheral functions.

    \item Moderate power consumption, given the mix of ICs and memory units.
\end{itemize}

Both architectures represent the transition from small-scale to more integrated processing units and reflect technological limitations like reliance on 5V logic, discrete memory units, and modular designs typical of the late 1970s.

\section{Architecture Type Comparison}

\subsection{Fairchild 9440}
The Fairchild 9440 architecture is accumulator-based. It features four 16-bit accumulators (AC0-AC3), which act as the primary storage for operands in arithmetic and logical operations. These accumulators are general-purpose and play a significant role in data movement and calculations, making it an accumulator-based architecture.

\subsection{microNOVA MP/100}
The microNOVA MP/100 architecture is also accumulator-based. It relies heavily on accumulators for data processing and operand storage. The specifics of the accumulator implementation are detailed in its technical documentation.

\subsection{Comparison}
Both systems are accumulator-based, leveraging accumulators as central components for their operations.

\section{Addressing Mechanisms}


\subsection{Fairchild 9440}
The Fairchild 9440 processor uses a two-address architecture, where most instructions specify a source operand and a destination operand. This means the same instruction can perform operations and store the result in a different location or overwrite the source.
\subsection{microNOVA MP/100}
microNOVA MP/100: The microNOVA MP/100 is a one-address architecture machine. Most instructions operate with a single explicit memory address operand, using the accumulator implicitly as the source or destination for operations

\subsection{Comparison}
Thus, the Fairchild 9440 is a two-address machine, while the microNOVA MP/100 operates as a one-address machine.

\section{Registers in Fairchild 9440 and microNOVA MP/100}

The register configurations of the Fairchild 9440 and microNOVA MP/100 architectures differed significantly in terms of type, count, and functionality.

\subsection{Fairchild 9440}

The Fairchild 9440 featured a \textbf{set of general-purpose registers} that supported its three-address instruction format. These registers were used for data manipulation, arithmetic operations, and temporary storage of intermediate results. The architecture had \textbf{16 general-purpose registers}, each with a width of \textbf{16 bits}. These registers provided a flexible environment for handling operations, minimizing memory access, and optimizing computational performance.

Additionally, the Fairchild 9440 included specialized registers, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Program Counter (PC):} Used to store the adress of the next instruction to be executed.
    \item \textbf{Status Register:} Contained flags for arithmetic and logic operations, such as carry, zero, overflow, and sign.
\end{itemize}

The combination of general-purpose and specialized registers enabled efficient handling of both simple and complex instructions.

\subsection{microNOVA MP/100}

The microNOVA MP/100, on the other hand, relied heavily on an \textbf{accumulator-based architecture}. The accumulator served as the primary working register for most arithmetic and logical operations. In addition to the accumulator, the architecture included the following specialized registers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Instruction Register (IR):} Held the current instruction being executed.
    \item \textbf{Program Counter (PC):} Tracked the memory address of the next instruction.
    \item \textbf{Stack Pointer (SP):} Used for managing the call stack during subroutine calls and interrupts.
\end{itemize}

Unlike the Fairchild 9440, the microNOVA MP/100 had fewer general-purpose registers, which limited its ability to store intermediate values and increased dependency on memory access. The accumulator and specialized registers in the microNOVA MP/100 were \textbf{8 bits wide}, reflecting the simpler and more compact design of this architecture.

    \item \textbf{Zero Flag (Z):} Set to 1 if the result of an operation is zero.
    \item \textbf{Carry Flag (C):} Indicates a carry out or borrow into the most significant bit in arithmetic operations.
    \item \textbf{Overflow Flag (V):} Set to 1 when an arithmetic operation results in an overflow.
    \item \textbf{Sign Flag (S):} Reflects the sign of the result (1 for negative, 0 for positive).
\end{itemize}

These flags facilitated conditional branching and error detection in operations, making the architecture robust for complex computations.

\subsection{microNOVA MP/100}

The microNOVA MP/100 also employed a \textbf{Status Register} for storing flags, although the set of flags was simpler due to its accumulator-based architecture. The following flags were used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Zero Flag (Z):} Set when the result of an operation is zero.
    \item \textbf{Carry Flag (C):} Indicates carry out or borrow into the most significant bit.
    \item \textbf{Negative Flag (N):} Represents the sign of the result (1 for negative, 0 for positive).
\end{itemize}

The microNOVA MP/100â€™s simpler flag set reflects its design for straightforward operations with minimal complexity.
